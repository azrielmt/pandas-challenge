# pandas-challenge

# These are my solutions for Module 4, which involved Pandas.
# The folder of 'PyCitySchools' will have both the ipynb file and the Word file that includes the written analysis.
# PyCitySchools.ipynb will have every solution.
# Written Analysis.doc will have a written analysis with two conclusions that I made when in the shoes of a Data Scientist.
# The Resources folder has the resources of the csv files only.
